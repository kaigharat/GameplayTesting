🕹️ Falling Objects Survival – Gameplay Testing Task

This repository contains a gameplay testing and balance evaluation task completed as part of an internship assessment.

The objective of this task was to design a minimal playable scenario and evaluate gameplay balance, difficulty progression, fairness, and player experience through structured testing and documentation.

🎯 Project Overview

The game is a simple survival scenario where the player controls a character and must avoid falling objects for as long as possible. The score increases over time, and the game ends when the player loses all lives.

The gameplay was intentionally kept minimal so that testing could focus on:

Difficulty scaling

Player reaction and positioning

Fairness vs frustration

Performance under stress

🧪 What Was Tested

Core gameplay loop and failure conditions

Difficulty progression (Easy → Medium → Hard)

Balance variables such as spawn rate and fall speed

Stress and edge case scenarios

Player experience, frustration, and cognitive load

Performance and input responsiveness
